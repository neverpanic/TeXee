Thanks for downloading TeXfy. To install TeXfy, extract the archive in your Expression Engine directory, upload the added files and enable TeXfy in the Extension Manager in your control panel by going to Admin » Utilities » Extensions Manager and clicking “enable” in the table row for TeXfy.
If you're updating from a previous version of TeXfy the process is the same.
